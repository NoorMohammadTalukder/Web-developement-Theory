## Client-side Development

This section covers the fundamentals of client-side web development. It explains the technologies, tools, and techniques used to build interactive user interfaces and dynamic web applications on the client-side.

## Server-side Development

The server-side development section discusses the server-side technologies and frameworks used to handle requests, process data, and generate dynamic responses. It explores concepts such as server-side languages, databases, and server architecture.

## JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format widely used for representing structured data. This section explains the syntax and usage of JSON, along with examples of how it can be utilized in web development.

## HTTP Requests

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests are fundamental to web development. This section provides an overview of different types of HTTP requests, their purpose, and how to make HTTP requests from both the client-side and server-side.

## Middleware

Middleware is a crucial concept in web development that sits between the client and server components. It allows for processing and modifying requests and responses in a modular and reusable manner. This section explains the role of middleware in web applications and provides examples of its implementation.
